# Javascript Basics

This section of lessons will cover the first building blocks of javascript knowledge. We will first start with 'why are we even learning javascript of all possible choices?' then go into the fundamentals of it. Basics will include `variables`, `types`, `scope`, `conditional blocks`, and `loops`.

### Why Javascript?

This is a good question because javascript is admittedly not the ideal first language to learn. It is very loosely typed with lot of 'gotcha' knowledge that only come with experience of using the language.

That said, few reasons why I chose this

- It is currently the most popular language due to the fact is it what all browsers natively run. This is extremely powerful as every operating system (MacOSX, Windows, Linux, shit probably even TempleOS) runs browsers. This cross-compatibility has made javascript not only the language of choice for browsers, but industry-level servers as well (NodeJs), as well as slew of resources based on it.
- Based on above fact, it is very easy to run on computers, making the setup much easier for you and me.
- I, as a programmer, am strongest in javascript. Though I've developed professionally in Java (yes, Java does NOT equal javascript) and Ruby, my main professional language has been js for the past half decade plus.

## Lessons

Below are our lessons, covered live in twitch.

### Lesson One: Variables and Types

Variables, in coding terms, are information that is stored that we can reference later to use. Variable behaves differently depending on how you declare it. We will focus on javascript variables here.

Javascript variables are very freeform. They can hold anything, including nothing. I'll explain in detail, don't worry.

### Variable assignment with let

Recommend you open up codepen.io or your development environment such as VSCode and type stuff along. Here is how a javascript variable is declared.

`let newVariable = 10;`

lets deconstruct above statement. `let` is a way to tell javascript code that I am declaring a NEW variable. There's 3 types of variables, `let` `var` and `const`, but let's just worry about `let` for now. After telling javascript you are declaring a variable with `let`, you can name it whatever you want. In our example, I named it `newVariable` to make it obvious I'm naming it.

A JavaScript variable name must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0â€“9).

Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase). `newvariable` would've been a fine name, but I capitalized the second letter to make it easier to read the second word. It must all be one word, having space in between does not work.

Then, we *assign* a value to `newVariable` using `=` followed by a value, which in this case is `10`. Then we use `;` to tell javascript this is one line of code.

All that combined results in a new variable named `newVariable` with the value `10` that we can reference later in code. Let's declare another variable.

```
let newVariable = 10;
let anotherOne = newVariable;
```

Yes, a variable can be another variable! So `anotherOne` currently holds the value of `10`. Let's go one step further.

```
let newVariable = 10;
let anotherOne = newVariable;
newVariable = 5;
```

You can re-assign new values to already declared variables. Notice that we don't have a `let` before re-assignment. This is because for per *scope* of code, variable names must be unique. We'll get to what Scope is later :)

Question: What do you think the value of `anotherOne` became after the re-assignment?

```
let newVariable = 10;
let anotherOne = newVariable;
newVariable = 5;

console.log(newVariable) // outputs 5
console.log(anotherOne) // ?
```

anotherOne actually holds the value of... `10`! When you assign a *primitive* type variable to something, it BECOMES that value instead of POINTING to the value. What are *primitive* variables? Again, I'll explain in detail later, I got you. But let's go over the crazy `console.log` statement I threw out quick.

### `console.log()` Part 1

This basically tells the javascript code to output the evaluated value within the parenthesis, `()`, to the console. Warning: I'm about to use some terms in the next few sentences that won't make sense until later, please bear with me, it'll be covered in upcoming lessons and I'll circle back.

`console` is a global *object* that is defined by default in javascript. You can type in `console.log(console)` in codepen and it'll spit out the object and its definitions. `log()` part in `console.log()` is a *Function* that is defined within `console` that logs whatever *argument* is within the parenthesis to the console. I know it's a lot, we'll circle back to this later when we get there! For now, it's important to learn that `console.log()` outputs your results, and you'll be using it often to debug your program.

Let's take the code we wrote so far and output each step using console.log.

```
let newVariable = 10;
console.log(newVariable); // outputs 10
let anotherOne = newVariable;
console.log(anotherOne); // outputs 10
newVariable = 5;

console.log(newVariable); // outputs 5
console.log(anotherOne); // outputs 10
```

Above code block will output `10, 10, 5, 10` in your console. This step-by-step approach of logging code values will help you write and understand a javascript code as it runs.

### Primitive Types

Primitive value means that when you assign a primitive type value to a variable, it BECOMES that value instead of POINTING to it. We saw an example of how that works earlier when we re-assigned a new value to a variable that has been assigned to another variable. Basically, to show via example again,

```
let x = 1; // 1 is a number, a primitive type
let y = x; // y now BECOMES 1. it does not POINT to x, it BECOMES 1
// so at this point, x === 1, and y === 1.

x = 2; // x is now equal to 2. This does not effect y at all.
// at this point, x === 2, and y === 1 because numbers are primitive types.
```

Let's learn a new command. Type this into your javascript console or a new js file you will run.

```
let x = 5;
console.log(typeof x); // outputs 'number'
```

you should see the output `"number"`. Notice the quotations around it - it means the output is a **string**. What is a string? I'll explain in detail in a bit. I wanna step back and explain 'types'.

**Type** is how a data is defined in a programming language. It allows different operations and interactions - for example, telling the program to add two numbers together (think 1 + 1) is different from adding two words together.

Let's go over each **Primitive types** below.

#### String

String, in layman's terms, it's what we think of when we hear the word 'sentence' - a series of alphanumerics. In any programming language, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent a text. Do you remember how I said some types are *primitive* earlier? String is a primitive.

To declare a string, you wrap alphanumeric characters within EITHER `'` or `"`. Yes, they are BOTH STRINGS. This is pretty unique to Javascript, as usually in other languages quotes and apostrophe define different types of variables. Not in Javascript.

You may ask, why would you need one over the other? To write a string with `"` within it, you'd write something like `'hello, "world"'`. The outer `'` denotes that we are describing a string value, and inside `"` is treated as a character in a string.

- Primitive: Yes
- Examples: `"hello world"`, `"x"`, `'hello world'`
- Typeof output: 'string'
- Typeof Example:
```
let stringVar = "hello, world";
console.log(typeof stringVar); // outputs 'string'

stringVar = 'hello, world';
console.log(typeof stringVar); // outputs 'string'
```

#### Number

Number is... a number! Number is defined by sequence of mathematically-numeric characters, such as 1, 10, 100.13013, or 10e100.

- Primitive: Yes
- Examples: `1`, `10`, `1.12`
- Typeof output: 'number'
- Typeof Example:
```
let numVar = 1;
console.log(typeof numVar); // outputs 'number'

numVar = 1.25;
console.log(typeof numVar); // outputs 'number'
```

#### Boolean

Boolean is a binary (means has 2), logical data type that only has 2 values - `true`, or `false`.

- Primitive: Yes
- Examples: `true`, `false`
- Typeof output: 'boolean'
- Typeof Example:
```
let trueVar = true;
console.log(typeof trueVar); // outputs 'boolean'

let falseVar = false;
console.log(typeof falseVar); // outputs 'boolean'
```

### Introduction to non-existant values

We've gone over all the primitive values that represent the presence of some data. The next primitives we'll go over represent the ABSENCE of data. The concept of representing nothing with something is kind of strange, but very important in programming.

#### undefined

Undefined is a primitive value that is assigned to any correctly (syntax-wise) declared variables that was not assigned a value. So, simply typing in `let x` declares a variable `x` that has the value of `undefined`. It helps to think of `undefined` as a badly named definition of a value. As in, it actually is defined - it is defined as something called 'undefined'.

- Primitive: Yes
- Examples: `let x; // x was not assigned any value, so it has the value 'undefined'`
- Typeof output: 'undefined'
- Typeof Example:
```
let someVar;
console.log(typeof someVar); // outputs 'undefined'

let someOtherVar = undefined;
console.log(typeof someOtherVar); // outputs 'undefined'
```

javascript `undefined` is kind of a mess because so many things default to undefined, and like you saw in the example above, you can actually assign a value of `undefined` to a variable. (Kinda oxymoronic... you're defining something as undefined.) Understanding the full picture of `undefined` really comes with experience, guidance and practice, which i hope to provide you guys with :)

#### null

`null` is a primitive value that is intentionally defined as a non-existent. So when you want to assign a value to a variable declaring it as completely nulled/non-existent, you can set it to the value `null`. An example of where you might want this is if you want to make sure you want to use some variable once, you may turn it to null after you use it and check to make sure it is not null before usage.

There is a pretty ridiculous gotcha about null in javascript, which is actually a deep seated, wont-be-fixed bug in the language. `typeof null` outputs... `object`. This is fucky because `object` is NOT a primitive value. (We'll go over objects later!) However, null absolutely is a primitive - any variable assigned null BECOMES null, not point to whatever variable it was. Why does it do this? Again, it's a BUG. Read the history of why this happened below.

https://2ality.com/2013/10/typeof-null.html

- Primitive: Yes
- Examples: `null`
- Typeof output: 'object'
- Typeof Example:
```
let nullVar = null;
console.log(typeof nullVar); // outputs 'object'
```

### Lesson Two: Conditionals

We make decisions all the time based on some truth. We may ask, 'should I go for a run?' and decide yes or no based on some factor: 'i will not go run, for it is raining'. This type of decision making based on a condition is expressed in javascript via Conditionals. The most commonly used of which is the `if/else` statement.

#### if else

if ... else looks like this.
```
if (condition) {
  // run code written here, between the { and }, if the 'condition' evaluates to true
} else {
  // run code written here if the 'condition' is falsey
}
```

Let's break this down.
1. The first statement `if` tells the javascript engine we are declaring a conditional block.
2. `condition` is placed inside a parenthesis. Inside this parenthesis will be evaluated by javascript to see if that condition is true or not. For example, maybe you might check if some number is greater than another.
3. Curly braces. Code inside the first curly braces will run if `condition` is evaluated as true.
4. `else` followed by curly braces. Code in the `else` block will run if `condition` is evaluated as false.

Let's try writing some actual condition in. In javascript, you can use less than or greater than (`<`, `>`) symbols like in mathematics.

```
let x = 1;

if (x > 0) {
  console.log('x is greater than zero.')
} else {
  console.log('x is smaller or equal to zero.')
}
```

Above code block will output `x is greater than zero`. Note that `else` doesn't need to be there for a conditional statement. Following is perfectly acceptable javascript

```
let x = 1;

if (x > 0) {
  console.log('x is greater than zero.');
}

console.log('hello world.'); // this code will always run, whether x was greater than 0 or not.
```

You can also use `<=`, `>=` symbols combined to express the condition 'less than or equal to,' or 'greater than equal to'. So in example

```
let x = 1;

if (x >= 0) {
  console.log('x is greater than or is zero.')
} else {
  console.log('x is smaller than zero, a negative number.')
}
```

#### Equality check

Oftentimes, we want to check if some value is equal to another. In javascript, this is done like so:

```
let y = 1;

if (y === 1) {
  console.log('y is 1.');
}
```

This `===` checks if the left side of the expression is equal to the right. How do you check if it is NOT equal?

```
let z = 2;

if (z !== 1) {
  console.log('z is not 1.');
} else {
  console.log('z is 1.');
}
```

as shown, `!==` is checking is the left side of the expression is NOT equal to the right. The `else` block will only trigger if the condition `(z !== 1)` is false, which must mean it is equal to 1.

What happens if multiple blocks that can be true are chained like this?

```
let y = 1;
let z = 2;

if (y === 1) {
  console.log('y is 1.');
} else if (z === 2) {
  console.log('z is 2.');
} else {
  console.log('y is not 1. z is not 2.');
}
```

Expressions of logic always evaluate in-order of code. So in above example, the first condition block, `y === 1` will evaluate as true. After outputting `y is 1`, the other else blocks are not evaluated because the first `if` condition was met.

#### Javascript value comparisons

So what does it really mean to be a `truthy` condition in javascript? Does a string expression evaluate to a true condition, if used like so?
```
let stringVar = 'hello, world';

if (stringVar) {
  console.log('and hello to you too!');
}
```
The answer is... yes! You will run into this in js again and again; learning whether each value evaluates to `true` if used as a conditional is important to become a proficient javascript developer. Here is the rule:

**Any value that is not `false`, `undefined`, `null`, `0`, `NaN`, or an empty string ('') actually returns true!**

I know that is kind of unintuitive at first, but see this code below.
```
let stringVar = 'hello, world';
let x = -1;
let y = 0;
let z;

if (stringVar) {
  console.log('stringVar is truthy.');
}
if (x) {
  console.log('x is truthy.');
}
if (y) {
  console.log('y is truthy.');
}
if (z) {
  console.log('z is truthy.');
}
```
Above program will output `stringVar is truthy` and `x is truthy`. Yes, negative numbers are truthy, but 0 is not.

Using `typeof` command we learned earlier, we can check for types of a variable before executing some code.
```
let stringVar = 'hello, world';

if (typeof stringVar === 'string') {
  console.log('found a string variable!');
}
```
This is very useful and a commonly used pattern in javascript coding.

#### Logical Operators - AND, OR, and NOT

So far we learned to check if something IS. How do we express if something IS AND / OR something? Or, how do we check if something IS NOT something?

In js, we describe above scenarios using what are called **logical operators**. They are named **AND** (`&&`), **OR** (`||`), and **NOT** (`!`). In the next section, we describe each of these operators in terms of logic mathematics, and how javascript chooses to evaluate these operators.

#### AND OR

![logicgatetable](https://arith-matic.com/notebook/img/logic-gates/and-or-logic-gate.jpg)

Above is a representation of a logical gate. This is used in electronic circuits to represent the logic of AND and OR. Say 0 represents `false` and 1 represents `true`. So if our input was A and B, 1 would represent `true` and 0 would represent `false`.

The logical gate AND, when given A and B with binary values of 1 or 0, only output 1 (again, representing `true`) if and only if both A and B are `1`.

The logical gate OR, when given A and B with binary values of 1 or 0, outputs 1 if at least one of A or B is 1, including the case when they are both 1.

#### NOT

NOT gate, in lieu to the binary 0-false and 1-true example above, would simply give you the other binary value from the one given. So if input is 1, it'd become 0. If input was 0, it'd become 1.

These above 3 gates are fundamental building blocks of logic. By chaining these gates together, stuff like stoplights / flashlights with multiple settings are built. Understanding the logical operations and how we abstract each binary value to represent a state is important to learning not only javascript, but all of coding and computer science.


#### How logical operators work in javascript

Here's a table of how to express the logic operators in javascript.

Name | Syntax | Description
--- | --- | ---
AND | `condition1 && condition2` | if condition1 is truthy, returns condition2. If condition1 is not truthy, return condition1.
OR | `condition1 || condition2` | if condition1 is truthy, returns condition1. If not, return condition2.
NOT | `!condition` | returns the boolean `false` if `condition` is truthy. If not, returns `true`.

It may seem the descriptions seem unrelated to the logical tables we went over above. That's why it was important to go over the concept of the logic tables first, then go into how javascript implemented them. The above concept, in the simplest case, each `condition` variables would be just booleans. Let's go over the `AND` operator with the simple case of `boolean` variables.

```
console.log(false && false) // outputs false
console.log(true && false) // outputs false
console.log(false && true) // outputs false
console.log(true && true) // outputs true
```
You will notice that this pretty much follows the logic gate described above - It only outputs true when both are true. However, what javascript is actually doing is "if condition1 is truthy, returns condition2. If condition1 is not truthy, return condition1." If you follow that rule to each of the cases listed, you'll see that statement is true.

This is important to understand because in javascript each condition isn't simply a binary 1 or 0, but any type of value such as 'string', 'number', 'undefined', 'null', etc. Let's go over the above example with different value types.

```
console.log(undefined && null) // outputs undefined
console.log(null && 'world') // outputs null
console.log('' && null) // outputs ''
console.log('hello' && null) // outputs null
console.log('hello' && 'world') // outputs 'world'
```

the && operator DOES NOT return a boolean `false` or `true` in javascript. It always returns either the first statement or second statement it is given, depending on their truthy state. The same concept goes for `||`

```
// boolean examples
console.log(false || false) // outputs false
console.log(true || false) // outputs true
console.log(false || true) // outputs true
console.log(true || true) // outputs true

// using || with other types
console.log(undefined || null) // outputs null
console.log(null || 'world') // outputs 'world'
console.log('' || null) // outputs null
console.log('hello' || null) // outputs 'hello'
console.log('hello' || 'world') // outputs 'hello'
```

As stated, the OR operator does the following logic: if condition1 is truthy, returns condition1. If not, return condition2. The behavior of these two logical operators is a pretty large 'gotcha' in javascript, and many developers go for years without fully understanding it. However, deep understanding of this is a valuable building block to becoming a great javascript engineer.

NOT operator, `!`, is different from the above two as it actually outputs a boolean `true` or `false`.

```
// boolean examples
console.log(!false) // outputs true
console.log(!true) // outputs false

// other types
console.log(!null) // outputs true
console.log(!'world') // outputs false
console.log(!undefined) // outputs true
console.log(!'') // outputs true
```

This makes sense from implementation perspective, as 'NOT' of a `string` doesn't really make much sense, so it must be converted into a true/false statement (a `boolean`) before giving a reasonable answer.

#### Logical order of operations

Let's consider this code below. It's a bit trickier, but we'll go over it in detail.

```
let x = 1;
let y = null;

console.log(x === 1 || !x && y)
```

What would console.log output here? Let's think this through together. If one assumes that javascript will do this in order, we could evaluate it like so:

1. `x === 1` becomes true as `x` is `1`, so let's think of this as `console.log(true || !x && y)`
2. Since OR (`||`) statements returns the left-side statement if it is truthy, we don't even have to worry about `!x` part of that. `console.log(true || !x && y)` becomes `console.log(true && y)`
3. Since AND (`&&`) returns the right-side statement if the left side is truthy, it becomes `y`, so statement becomes `console.log(y)`, which outputs `null`.

However, when you run this code, it actually outputs the boolean `true`!! This is because the `&&` operator is executed before the `||` operator, kinda like how in good old PEMDAS, multiplication is executed before addition! What actually happened is

1. Within `console.log(x === 1 || !x && y)`, `&&` operator is executed first. So we look at `!x && y`. `x` is a number with a value that is not `0`, so it is truthy. `!x`, therefore, becomes `false`. Since AND (`&&`) immediately returns the left-side statement if it was falsey, we don't even have to look at `y`. The statement `!x && y` becomes `false`. Let's simplify the current step of our console statement as `console.log(x === 1 || false)`
2. Since OR statements return the left-side statement if it is truthy, we don't evaluate the `false` expression on the right in `console.log(x === 1 || false)`. The left side becomes `true`, so the entire expression becomes `true`.

Phew, we figured out what's going on. So what if you want to evaluate the `||` statement first instead of letting javascript engine do what it wants? Just like in math, we use parenthesis:

```
let x = 1;
let y = null;

console.log((x === 1 || !x) && y) // this will run the `||` statement first, then `&&`
```
This above code will execute as we detailed the first time through, when we assumed javascript will evaluate code in order. If you're curious, here's the [full list of order precendence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)... though at this point lot of stuff on there you wouldn't know about. Just remember to put things in parenthesis if you're expecting that expression to be evaluated first!

Another example of this, bit trickier, is
```
let x = 1;

if (!typeof x === 'string') {
  console.log('x is not a string');
} else {
  console.log('x is a string');
}
```

When writing this, we are expecting to evaluate `typeof x === 'string'`, then take the `NOT` of that, effectively checking that `typeof x` is NOT a string. However, this code will output `x is a string` when run!

This is, as you may have guessed, because of order of operations. Let's go through what's happening in detail.
1. javascript evaluates `typeof x` part of the statement first, which becomes `'number'`. Let's write that out: `if (!'number' === 'string')`
2. The `!` is applied to `'number'`, becoming `(false === 'string')`. Since `false` is not equal(`===`) to `'string'`, the `if` statement evaluates as falsey and goes to the `else` statement.

To solve this problem, we can use the parenthesis like this:
```
let x = 1;

if (!(typeof x === 'string')) {
  console.log('x is not a string');
} else {
  console.log('x is a string');
}
```
Which would evaluate the parenthesis, in this order:
1. javascript evaluates `typeof x` part of the statement first, which becomes `'number'`. Let's write that out: `if (!('number' === 'string'))`
2. Since `'number' === 'string'` is false, it becomes `if (!(false))`
3. Then, the `!` makes the `false` become `true.`. The `if` statement is evaluated as truthy, and it will output the first code block.

Or even simpler, we can just use `!==`
```
let x = 1;

if (typeof x !== 'string') {
  console.log('x is not a string');
} else {
  console.log('x is a string');
}
```
Which would be easier to read and understand, so is the recommended way of writing such code.

## Lesson 3: Non-primitive types

Everything we've learned so far was to introduce these more complex types. Specifically, we will cover functions and objects, the core building blocks of programming and how they behave in javascript.

#### Function

Functions are a way in javascript to enclose a set of statements that performs a specific task or calculation. This is powerful as it allows us to encapsulate any complex set of code and re-use it anywhere else later. Let's learn how to define functions.

```
function add(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}
```

The statement `function` declares what is to follow will be the name of the function with arguments it takes. Arguments here are `number1` and `number2`. When you declare those arguments, they are automatically defined as a variable within the enclosing `{}` brackets. `return` is important - it immediately returns the following statement to the caller. That means any code after the `return` statement is unreacheable, like so:

```
function add(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;

  console.log('got here');
}
```
In the above case, `'got here'` will never show up in the console, and is dead code - code that is useless because it can never execute.

Let's use this function we just declared.
```
function add(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}

let x = 1;
let y = 1;
let sum = add(x, y);

console.log(sum); // outputs 2
```

It's not required to save the result of a function into a variable, it just evaluates to whatever it `return`s. An example
```
function add(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}

let x = 1;
let y = 1;

console.log(add(x, y)); // outputs 2
```

It is also possible to declare a function as a variable!
```
let add = function(number1, number2) {
  return number1 + number2;
}

let x = 1;
let y = 1;

console.log(add(x, y)); // outputs 2
```

#### return

You can return any statement that evaluates. Simple cases for types such as below.

```
// below are just examples of return statements
return true;
return 'hello';
return add(x, y); // would return whatever add() function returns
```

Some less obvious way to return might be using our && / || behavior we went over.

```
let x = false;
let y = 'I am the walrus';
return x || y // returns 'I am the walrus'
```

as we know, in above statement `x || y` the behavior of `||` makes it so the statement evaluates to `y`, which is 'I am the walrus'.

It's important to remember that you do not have to return anything!
```
function printNumber(someNum) {
  if (typeof someNum === 'number') {
    return someNum;
  } else {
    return;
  }
}
```

We can see our second `return` statement has nothing except the semicolon after it. What does it return when it gets to that code block?
```
let result = printNumber("Not a number type");

console.log(result); // what does this statement print?
```

The answer is `undefined`. Returning nothing, to javascript, is simply returning an `undefined` value. In fact, that `return` is not necessary in the function. Consider the following change
```
function printNumber(someNum) {
  if (typeof someNum === 'number') {
    return someNum;
  }
}
```
The above function behaves exactly the same as the function with a second `else return` statement. When a function code reaches the end of execution without encountering any `return` statements, it simply returns `undefined` and ends execution.

#### Calling functions

Functions are evaluated soon as it is called, so you can use it in various contexts. For example, let's say the functions we discussed as examples, `add` and `squareNumber` has been declared. You can use them like below
```
let x = 1;
let y = 1;

let answer = squareNumber(add(x, y));
console.log(answer); // outputs 4
```

So the innermost `add(x,y)` is evaluated first, becoming `2`, then that becomes the argument for `squareNumber`, which returns `4`. We print the `answer` after.

Functions do not need an argument, it can simply run a grouping of code without any.
```
function printHelloWorld() {
  console.log('hello, world');
}

printHelloWorld();
printHelloWorld(); // we called it twice, so hello world is output to the console twice.
```

It's important to remember that when declaring a function like this, code within the function has no context of the caller. What I mean is shown below
```
let str = 'hello, world.';

function printStr() {
  console.log(str); // prints `undefined`, as `str` is not defined within this scope.
}
```
Above code introduces the very important concept of **scope**, which we will go over in detail later in upcoming lessons.

**Calling functions with missing arguments**

Javascript is very (some argue it is too) flexible and do not require every declared parameter to actually have a value assigned!

```
function squareNumber(input) {
  if (typeof input === 'number') {
    return input * input;
  } else {
    console.log('please give me a number');
  }
}

squareNumber(); // outputs 'please give me a number'
```

What's going on here? Let's modify our function to give us more details on our input to learn about it.

```
function squareNumber(input) {
  if (typeof input === 'number') {
    return input * input; // note: `*` is a multiplication operator in javascript
  } else {
    console.log('you gave me a type of ' + typeof input) // yes, you can add strings together and they become joined
    console.log('please give me a number'); // we removed the return statement below
  }
}

squareNumber(); // outputs 'you gave me a type of undefined' and 'please give me a number'
```

So functions actually just declares the arguments with value assigned, or simply declares it as undefined. You can see why actually setting some variable as `undefined`, like `let something = undefined`, is a bad practice - javascript sets things as undefined for you on anything that's declared but not assigned a value. We'll see more examples of this soon!

Function is its own type as well. This is the first **non-primitive** value we have learned!
```
// ... assume there's code that declared add as a function like we've been doing
console.log(typeof add) // outputs 'function'
```

What is special about non-primitive values? Well, to fully understand the concept, let's learn another very important non-primitive value - Objects.

### Object

Objects can be thought of data with properties attached to it. In real life, an object, say, apple, also has properties. Its color may be red, while its weight might be 2 ounces.

Let's define an object here.

```
let apple = {};
```

We've just defined an object named `apple`! Just like a real object, a javascript object should have variables that is attached as its property.

```
let apple = {};
apple.color = 'red';

console.log(apple);
```

The above should output something like `{ color: 'red' }`. We initialized the object with `let apple = {}` then added a property `color` in the next line. There's multiple ways to initialize an object - you can set values right as you create one.

```
let apple = {};
apple.color = 'red';

console.log(apple);

let greenApple = {
  color: 'green'
};

console.log(greenApple);
```

The second apple defined here immediately defined its property using the syntax `color: 'green'`. The left hand side here, `color`, is called the **key** of the property. Right hand side, `'green'`, is the **value**.

Let's add the weight property to our objects.
```
let apple = {};
apple.color = 'red';
apple.weight = '2oz';

console.log(apple);

let greenApple = {
  color: 'green',
  weight: '2oz'
};

console.log(greenApple);
```

Each property in an object assignment as shown in
```
let greenApple = {
  color: 'green',
  weight: '2oz'
};
```
must be separated by commas.

Both ways of initializing the apple objects are valid and achieved the same result. Of course, you can add or edit additional properties no matter method of initialization.

```
let apple = {};
apple.color = 'red';
apple.weight = '2oz';

console.log(apple);

let greenApple = {
  color: 'green',
  weight: '2oz'
};

greenApple.weight = '3oz'; // correct the weight
console.log(greenApple);
```
We just overwrote the `weight` property in `greenApple` with a new value.

#### Accessing Object values

We've seen how to create an object. Let's go into how to access its properties.

```
let greenApple = {
  color: 'green',
  weight: '2oz'
};

console.log(greenApple.weight); // outputs '2oz'
let greenAppleWeight = greenApple.weight;
console.log(greenAppleWeight); // outputs '2oz'
```

the `<objectName>.<propertyKeyName>` notation (named dot notation) is how you access the property key value in javascript. Let's introduce another way to access the values.

```
let greenApple = {
  color: 'green',
  weight: '2oz'
};

console.log(greenApple['color']) // outputs 'green'
```
This `<objectName>[<propertyKeyName>]` is called the bracket notation and is another valid way to access a property value. What's important to remember is that the key name is stored as a **string**! To drive this point, see the following code
```
let greenApple = {
  color: 'green',
  weight: '2oz'
};
let colorString = 'color';

console.log(greenApple[colorString]) // outputs 'green'
```

#### When to use bracket notation

So when would you use one over the other? The bracket notation should be used when you are using a variable to represent a property key name. To illustrate this point, let's make a function that creates an apple object.

```
function makeApple(givenColor) {
  let weightMap = {
    red: '2oz',
    green: '3oz',
    blue: '0oz' // the mythical floating apple
  };

  return {
    color: givenColor,
    weight: weightMap[givenColor]
  }
}

makeApple('red') // returns { color: 'red', weight: '2oz' }
makeApple('blue') // returns { color: 'blue', weight: '0oz' }
```

This was a bit more complex, so let's dive in a bit. This function named `makeApple` first defines an object called `weightMap` that, when given a property key of `red` `green` or `blue` returns a string that represents a weight. This object is used to construct the returned object.

We can see the simplicity of using an object as a mapping from some value to another. This is why we named the variable `weightMap`, as it is a `map` of the color to its weight value. Imagine writing the `weight` property based on color without the `map`; it would have to be something like
```
// ... inside the makeApple function..
let apple = { color: givenColor };

if (givenColor === 'red') { apple.weight = '2oz'; }
else if (givenColor === 'green') { apple.weight = '3oz'; }

return apple
```
Which is a lot more code than our solution using the `weightMap` above, and much more work to add new key/value combos as we'd have to write an `if` statement for each to color/weight combination. Using a `map`, we can simply just define the new property and it'd be recognized.
