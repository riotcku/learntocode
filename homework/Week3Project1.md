# Week 3 Project 1 - Using Objects

This homework assignment is designed to get you more comfortable with every type you've learned in basics so far.

### Instructions

Write a javascript file that completes the following set of requirements.

1. Declare an object named after your favorite fruit.
2. This object must have the following properties
  key: `color`
  value: a string describing its color.
  key: `shape`
  value: a string describing its shape.
  key: `price`
  value: a number between 0-421 describing its cost.
3. Declare a function that takes an fruit object you made and outputs its `color`, `shape` and `price` to the console.

Extra credit: Your function will output an error message if
1. the given argument is not an 'object' type
2. the object given does not have the properties `color`,`shape`, and `price`.

You can write the error message using `console.log('errormessage here')` or if you want to be fancy, `console.error('errormessage here')`

### Turning it in

Rename the file similar to the first project: `{first name or discord name}-objects.js` So mine might be called `chris-objects.js` or `ink-objects.js`.

Turn this assignment in preferably via discord. I will also accept email (my email will be written in our discord `#homework` channel) or facebook turn ins.

Best of luck!
