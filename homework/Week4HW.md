# Week 4 Homework 1 - Array Manipulation 1

This homework assignment is designed to get you bit used to manipulating an Array.

### Instructions

Write a javascript file that completes the following set of requirements.

- Create an Array of length **100** that is filled with numbers where each number represents its length, like so: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 99, 100]`
  * You must use a for loop to populate this array.
  * You must use `push` to add numbers to this array.

- After you create above array, create another for loop to add `10` to each item in the array.

- Create another for loop that traverses the array you created. When you find number `50`, remove that element from the array using `splice` and exit the loop (`break`).

### Turning it in

Rename the file like: `{first name or discord name}-array1.js` So mine might be called `chris-array1.js` or `ink-array1.js`.

Turn this assignment in preferably via discord DM. I will also accept email (my email will be written in our discord `#homework` channel) or facebook turn ins.

Best of luck!
