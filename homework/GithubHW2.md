# Github Homework

This homework assignment asks the student to make a pull request.

### Instructions

You must complete [the first github assignment](https://github.com/riotcku/learntocode/blob/master/homework/GithubHW1.md) to do this one.

Clone our `learntocode` repository by first going to our [main page](https://github.com/riotcku/learntocode/) and clicking the Clone or download button. There, you should see Clone with SSH and something you can copy. Click the `Use HTTPS` button next to it as we haven't set up our SSH yet. We'll go over that later. For now, copy the link it provides you when you click it.

Go to a directory you will remember - this directory will host our github repo. Type in `git clone <what_you_copied_from_above_step` and follow instructions.

Once you have cloned the repository, you are able to edit the repo yourself.

Create a new branch named `<your_name>_hw`. After, navigate to the directory named `workspace` and create a new folder with your discord or first name. Commit your changes, and push up your changes.

If it blocks you from pushing this step, contact me via discord with your discord name and I'll give you repository contributor access!

After pushing, create a Pull Request. That's it, you're done!

### Turning it in

I'll see your pull requests on my repository.
