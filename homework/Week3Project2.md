# Week 3 Project 2 - Using a For loop

This homework assignment is designed to test your ability of using a for loop.

### Instructions

First, get the [project javascript file](https://github.com/riotcku/learntocode/blob/master/homework/js/week3project2.js) into your VSCode environment. Again, this js file is incomplete - it is up to you to complete it!

The file has a function that generates an array of random numbers ranging from 1-1000. This is already done for you, as well as setting up the array using the function.

Your project is to finish the function `findLargestNumber`. It returns a nonsense string value of 'idk' currently - make the function iterate the parameter array and find the largest number in the list.

Complete the assignment as directed in `week3project2.js`. This means outputting to the console the largest number in the array with your completed `findLargestNumber` function. There's a simpler array already defined you can use to test your code as you develop.

This is a step up in challenge level as I have never shown you how to explicitly find a largest number in an Array. However, it is doable using what you already know. Feel free to work with others, and absolutely ask me questions if you feel stuck.

A hint - save the largest number you found so far outside the for loop, as each loop iteration has its own scope - the parent scope must have the knowledge of the current largest number.

### Turning it in

Rename the file `{first name or discord name}-forloop.js` So mine might be called `chris-forloop.js` or `ink-forloop.js`.

Turn this assignment in preferably via discord. I will also accept email (my email will be written in our discord `#homework` channel) or facebook turn ins.

Best of luck! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just need help.
