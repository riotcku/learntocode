# Practice Problems 1

By this point in our lesson, you are good enough where small practice questions shouldn't challenge you too much. As such, this homework throws you multiple questions that'll hopefully challenge you.

### Instructions

Write 3 functions as described below in a file called `practice.js`. Also, ask yourself when solving: What happens if the array is empty? What happens if all elements are the same number?

1. Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item of an array.

Sample array input: `[1, 'a', 1]`
Your function should output: `1 2`

Sample array input 2: `[3, ‘a’, ‘a’, ‘a’, 2, 3, ‘a’, 3, ‘a’, 2, 4, 9, 3]`
Your function should output: `a 5`

2. Write a javascript program to iterate nested arrays, putting all items into a single, 1-dimension array.

Sample array input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`
Your function should return: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`

Sample array input: `[[1], [2,3], [4,5,6]]`
Your function should return: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`

3. Write a JavaScript function to remove all falsey values ('null', '0', '""', 'false', 'undefined' and 'NaN') from an array.

Sample array input: `[NaN, 0, 15, false, -22, '',undefined, 47, null]`
Your function should return : `[15, -22, 47]`

### Turning it in

In your own workspace in our Github, after completing the above file, put it in a directory called `hw`, branch and commit the file. Submit a Pull Request with the completed homework within a directory called `hw` in your subdirectory.

Complete [the second Github HW](https://github.com/riotcku/learntocode/blob/master/homework/GithubHW2.md) if you do not yet have a workspace.

You could just turn in this js file by itself, but it is important you have a github set up going forward.
