# Week 5 Project - Array Sorting

This homework assignment is designed to challenge you to think about algorithms.

### Instructions

First, get the [project javascript file](https://github.com/riotcku/learntocode/blob/master/homework/js/ArraySort1.js) into your VSCode environment. Again, this js file is incomplete - it is up to you to complete it!

The file has a function that generates an array of random numbers ranging from 1-1000. This is already done for you, as well as setting up the array using the function.

Your assignment is to write a function sort the two arrays in this javascript file from smallest to largest.

As a hint, even before you start the problem, think to yourself how you would sort a bunch of papers with numbers on it. Step by step, think through the logic you would go through.

Me personally, I may first find the smallest number and place it on the left. Then find the next smallest number then put it to the right of the smallest number... and so on until I've sorted it all. There are many ways one could do this, this is just one example.

### Turning it in

Rename the file like: `{first name or discord name}-sort1.js` So mine might be called `chris-sort1.js` or `ink-sort1.js`.

Turn this assignment in preferably via discord DM. I will also accept email (my email will be written in our discord `#homework` channel) or facebook turn ins.

Best of luck. This one is by far the most challenging one we've done.
