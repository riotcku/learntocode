# Week 4 Homework 2 - Array Manipulation 2

This homework assignment is designed to practice traversing an Array.

### Instructions

Write a javascript file that completes the following set of requirements.

- Create an Array named `numberArray` that has length **1000**, filled with numbers where each number represents its index, like so: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 998, 999]`.

- Use `forEach()` on `numberArray` to square each number. So `1` would become `1`, `2` becomes `4`, `3` becomes `9`, and so on.

- Use `map()` on `numberArray` to create a new Array named `mapArray` where each element is mapped to an object with property `value` containing the element value, and `index` containing the element index. So, if this map function was run on an Array `[0, 1, 4]`, it would become `[{value: 0, index: 0}, {value: 1, index: 1}, {value: 4, index: 2}]`

### Turning it in

Rename the file like: `{first name or discord name}-array2.js` So mine might be called `chris-array2.js` or `ink-array2.js`.

Turn this assignment in preferably via discord DM. I will also accept email (my email will be written in our discord `#homework` channel) or facebook turn ins.

Best of luck!
