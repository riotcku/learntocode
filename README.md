### Introduction

This is my attempt at teaching you how to code from the ground up. This is understandably a difficult task, but I believe that if you put in effort, we will be able to get you to a sufficient level of javascript where you'll be able to know how to substantially increase your own skills.

Please do join our [discord server.](https://discord.gg/eYPgbp)

### Format

I plan on going over js concepts live on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/learnjs). Currently scheduled for Mon, Wed, Friday 8PM CST. All questions should be asked either live during a lesson stream or at our [discord server.](https://discord.gg/eYPgbp) That's where I'll be organizing class materials, homework, etc.

Each lesson will cover important materials. Lesson will be based on documentation here, but I may have additional materials live. Please attend lessons. If you can't make it, Twitch saves my VOD for 60 days. If you fall behind, I will direct you to watch the VOD first then answer your questions after.
